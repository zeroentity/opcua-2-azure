OPC UA to Microsoft Azure Bridge

This project is to create a simple bridge layer between an industrial OPC UA server and Azure IoT Hub, allowing easy industrial data transmission to Microsofts Cloud platform.

This implementation is essentially a Python version of the OPC UA Foundation Publisher Sample found here https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.UWP-Universal-Windows-Platform

Dependencies: Free OPC UA, Azure IoT SDK, PYQT5

Subscribing to a node forwards all OPC UA updates to Azure IoT Hub.
